### üöÄ Project Overview

### üí° Problem Statement

Before B Student Sphere, Bhavan's College students faced several challenges due to fragmented information and a lack of centralized communication:

* [cite_start]**Communication Challenges:** The absence of a centralized platform led to scattered information, making communication difficult among students. [cite: 100, 101]
